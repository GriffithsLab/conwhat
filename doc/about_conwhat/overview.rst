Overview

Classical and modern schemas for defining and characterizing neuroanatomical structures in white matter tissue can be categorized along two main dimensions *Ontology* and *Representation*. Each of these has two main flavours: tract-based/connectivity-based, and image-based/streamline-based. This perspective is a key part of the rationale for, and design of, the ConWhAt software and atlases. Read more about these concepts `here <http://conwhat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about_conwhat/ontology_and_representation.html>`_.
